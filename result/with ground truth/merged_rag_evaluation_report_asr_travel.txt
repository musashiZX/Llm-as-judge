6   I was standing in a bar I turned around and before I knew it my bag had been stolen from the stool, is this covered?                    0.85                                                             The generated response correctly identifies that theft of baggage is covered under the general definition of theft, as per the provided context. However, it does not address the ground truth answer, which discusses compensation for sickness, indicating a mismatch in context. The response is relevant to the question about theft coverage and uses the context appropriately, but it misses the specific aspect of sickness compensation. The response is clear and concise, focusing on the theft aspect without unnecessary information.
15                                              I rented skis and they are damaged. I have to pay €400, is this insured?                    0.80  The generated response accurately identifies that the insurance coverage depends on the inclusion of optional baggage or additional sports equipment coverage, which aligns with the context provided. However, it does not directly address the ground truth answer regarding coverage for valuables like tablets, which is not directly relevant to the question about skis. The response is relevant to the question and uses the context appropriately, focusing on the conditions under which the skis would be covered. It is fairly concise, providing necessary information without excessive detail.
20                                                            My sweater was stolen from my hotel room, is this insured?                    0.70                                                                                                                    The response accurately identifies that the provided context does not specifically mention coverage for personal items like a sweater, but it does not address the ground truth answer regarding debit card and money theft. It is relevant to the question and uses the context appropriately, but it lacks completeness as it does not cover all points from the ground truth. The response is clear and concise, focusing on the need to check the policy for optional baggage coverage.

3                                  My son has to retake an exam, so I want to cancel. Is this covered?                   0.250                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The generated response does not match the ground truth answer, which states that the loss of a phone is not covered. The generated response incorrectly addresses the question about canceling a trip due to an exam, which is not related to the ground truth answer. While the response is relevant to the question asked, it is not relevant to the ground truth answer. The response is concise but lacks accuracy and completeness in relation to the ground truth.
10                                              I bought paracetamol at the pharmacy, is this covered?                   0.325                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The generated response does not accurately address the ground truth answer, which is about correcting a broken tooth for aesthetic reasons. The response is somewhat relevant as it discusses coverage for medications, but it fails to directly answer the question about paracetamol. The response is concise but lacks completeness as it does not cover the specific point mentioned in the ground truth.
7   was in bed for three days because I was nauseous, can I get compensation for unused vacation days?                   0.350  The generated response inaccurately suggests eligibility for compensation based on unused ski passes and related expenses, which is not directly relevant to the question about unused vacation days due to nausea. The ground truth answer clearly states that compensation is not available for such circumstances, focusing on the policy's limitations regarding composite trip components. The response fails to cover this critical point, making it incomplete. While the response is somewhat relevant in discussing conditions for compensation, it does not directly address the user's specific situation. It is concise but includes unnecessary details about ski-related expenses, which are not pertinent to the user's query.
