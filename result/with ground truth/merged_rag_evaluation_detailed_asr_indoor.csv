"Due to a dishwasher leak, the laminate started to bulge. Is this insured?","Yes, damage caused by water from defective pipes and installations, such as the dishwasher, is insured.","The provided context does not contain specific information regarding coverage for damage caused by a dishwasher leak leading to laminate bulging.
