"Due to a dishwasher leak, the laminate started to bulge. Is this insured?","Yes, damage caused by water from defective pipes and installations, such as the dishwasher, is insured.","The provided context does not contain specific information about whether damage caused by a dishwasher leak, such as laminate bulging, is insured. The context mentions coverage for sudden and unforeseen events, but does not explicitly address water damage from appliances.
